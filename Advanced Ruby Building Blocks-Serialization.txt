1. the 2 ways are via JSON and YAML
2. you can store your objects/classes and transmit them via HTTP, which only accepts string
3. YAML is used to save configuration files in RoR since it's lightweight and straightforward
   JSON is the format of choice to deliver complex/deeply nested data such as objects from website to program via API
4. you can call to_json method to convert ruby object into json string
5. to return it back you can do JSON.load string or JSON.parse string to get object back
