1.A boolean value is one that results to true or false
2.truthy values are any expression that evaluates to true 
	truthy values:
	true
	object
	any fixnum, i.e. 0,1
	any string(object), i.e. "" "hi"
	empty objects are still truthy

	falsey values:
	nil
	false
3. nil is false, everything else evaluates to true, but they aren't equivalent to true/false
4. use elsif if you want to have linked if statements
5. use unless when you want to repeat a statement unless some condition becomes true
6. <=> is comparable operator, 
	a <=> b
	if a<b then return -1
	if a=b then return 0
	if a>b then return 1
	if a and b aren't comparable then return nil (different types of objects)

	if you use <=> on arrays then it goes by element to element, moves to another element until not return 0
7. You might define your own <=> method when you want to compare according to a certain way
8. || is logical or, it checks left then right, && checks both, ! reverses the boolean
9. puts("woah") || true returns true but also prints "woah"
10. ||= is equivalent of a || a = b, so a is set to b if a is false
11. ternary operator is a shorthand if/else if_this_is_a_true_value ? then_the_result_is_this : else_it_is_this
12. Use case statement when you know the possible choices
13. loops infinitely, keeps executing block statement until it hits break statement
14. 1 way to denote a block is with curly braces {}, another way is to use do...end
15. index variable is to denote the index of an array starting from 0 to arr.length-1
16. 

print each item of [1,3,5,7]
i=0
loop do
break if i==arr.length
print arr[i]
i+=1
end

i=0
while(i<4)
print arr[i]
i+=1
end

for item in arr do
print item
end

arr.each do |i|
print i
end

(arr.length).times do |i|
print arr[i]
end


17. until will execute at least once compared to while
18. you can use break statement to get out of loop
19. you can use next statement to get to next iteration
20. redo resets the current iteration, retry starts entire loop again
21. while is when you just have a stop condition
times is when you know how many times you want to iterate
each is when you want to iterate over every member of a list/array

22. nesting loops is when you have loops within loops, I would use it when finding subarrays etc
23. block is like a function in that it's some code that executes and that you can pass to methods
24. block does not have a name and it's not an object
25. 2 ways to declare a block are {} and do...end
26. you can return data from a block by calling return statement
27. if you include a return statement in a block, it'll automatically return 
28. a block can be reused in all different situations and not limited to just one method
29. yield runs the passed block
30. You can pass arguments to a block from within a method by passing a parameter to yield
31. You can check whether a block was passed in with block_given?
32. proc is a named block
33. block is not an object, proc is
34. you would use proc instead of a block when you need to reuse the block multiple times
35. a closure is a chunk of code that you can pass around but hangs onto the variables that you gave it when you first called it
36. lambda is a more formal form of proc, it checks for aguments passed and it 
37. lambda is more strict and return will return control back to method whereas proc will jump out 
38. a Method is a way of taking named methods and passing them as arguments
39. you can use a function as an argument and utilize that function within your current function
40. module is a collection of methods that can be included into other classes
41. modules are useful because you can include them with say array or hash classes and you can now use the packaged methods on arrays and hashes
42. each iterates over every element and does the block action
43. each returns original object
44. map iterates over every element and replaces the element with the block element
45. map returns new object
46. map and collect are the same
47. select iterates over every element and puts the elements for which the block returns true into a new array
48. select returns a new array
49. *see above
50. inject (reduce) is supplied with initial value and returns last value
51. you can use inject to sum elements of an array
52. to check every element fulfills a certain criteria, use all?
53. to check if none of the elements fulfill criteria, use none?
54. it's an implementation detail for Enumerators
55. ideally, a method should only do one thing
56. method should use only variables that have been passed in, don't modify globals, also don't modify the arguments or object the method was called on
57. descriptive name
58. self means the current object that the method is being called on
59. to create your own ruby script file simply create your_file.rb
60. Use ruby your_file.rb to run from command line
61. you can use if($0 == __FILE__)
$0 is the main or original file that was run 
__FILE__ is the name of the current file
62. one that modifies arguments that's being passed
63. require searches for the library in all defined search paths and makes sure library is included once
64. load needs to add full name of library and gets loaded every time you call load
65. load might load the library even if it's already on memory
66. there's a special global called ARGV that contains your input from command line
67. send lets you run a method
68. you can use send at runtime and no need to code your method again since rub ycan call call methods dynamically
