1.A boolean value is one that results to true or false
2.truthy values are any expression that evaluates to true 
	truthy values:
	true
	object
	any fixnum, i.e. 0,1
	any string(object), i.e. "" "hi"
	empty objects are still truthy

	falsey values:
	nil
	false
3. nil is false, everything else evaluates to true, but they aren't equivalent to true/false
4. use elsif if you want to have linked if statements
5. use unless when you want to repeat a statement unless some condition becomes true
6. <=> is comparable operator, 
	a <=> b
	if a<b then return -1
	if a=b then return 0
	if a>b then return 1
	if a and b aren't comparable then return nil (different types of objects)

	if you use <=> on arrays then it goes by element to element, moves to another element until not return 0
7. You might define your own <=> method when you want to compare according to a certain way
8. || is logical or, it checks left then right, && checks both, ! reverses the boolean
9. puts("woah") || true returns true but also prints "woah"
10. ||= is equivalent of a || a = b, so a is set to b if a is false
11. ternary operator is a shorthand if/else if_this_is_a_true_value ? then_the_result_is_this : else_it_is_this
12. Use case statement when you know the possible choices
13. loops infinitely, keeps executing block statement until it hits break statement
14. 1 way to denote a block is with curly braces {}, another way is to use do...end
15. index variable is to denote the index of an array starting from 0 to arr.length-1
16. 

print each item of [1,3,5,7]
i=0
loop do
break if i==arr.length
print arr[i]
i+=1
end

i=0
while(i<4)
print arr[i]
i+=1
end

for item in arr do
print item
end

arr.each do |i|
print i
end

(arr.length).times do |i|
print arr[i]
end


17. until will execute at least once compared to while
18. you can use break statement to get out of loop
19. you can use next statement to get to next iteration
20. redo resets the current iteration, retry starts entire loop again
21. while is when you just have a stop condition
times is when you know how many times you want to iterate
each is when you want to iterate over every member of a list/array

22. nesting loops is when you have loops within loops, I would use it when finding subarrays etc
